==> This Program is used in the Final bash script to compensate for the fact that most the scripts were written in Window OS. When running these scripts in Linux, they give an 'bad interpreter' error due to the different conventions used in Window and Linux when going to a new line. In Windows it uses ("\r\n") whereas in Linux its just ("\n").

You have to install these to run the main bash sciprt on you computer
